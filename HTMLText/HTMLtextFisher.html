    <h1> Welcome to my web page.</h1>

    <h3> (Lets learn HTML!)</h2>
    <p> Before we start let me tell you a little about myself.
      This is the 1<sub>st</sub> time that I have taught this course.
      I was born at a very young age ange grew in wisdom and grace until now.
      Of course,I hope to continue to grown in both wisdom and grace but that will
      require effort and attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you
      learn alot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good luck!

    <p> When writing web pages you need to make sure you are attentive to lots of details like the structure and formatting of the page.
      I want to <strong> emphasize </strong> to you the importance of this.

      I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.<blockquote> it is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing web pages. Afterall, small details can make a big difference. Be concious of what you are learning and why you are learning it. We will certainly learn a lot this class but we must always exert effort to learn</blockquote>
